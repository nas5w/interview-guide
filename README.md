# Interview Resources

This repo was initially home to the just the "external resources" listed below, but has since grown a bit as I'm starting to include some opinionated advice for approaching software development interview prep as well. So far, I have written the following:

- [Leetcode-style interviews](./leetcode)
- [Behavioral interviews](./behavioral)
- Other interview types coming soon!

# External Resources

I find big lists overwhelming. Here's a non-overwhelming list of resources I use for software development interview prep.

Please star this repo and share with friends/colleagues if you find it helpful!

# Contributing to this list

I'm happy to discuss adding resources to this list, but one of my goals is to keep it lean. I find really large lists to be unapproachable. If you'd still like to recommend a resource, create an issue and I'll review it. Just a fair warning that I will be very discerning before adding things to the list!
