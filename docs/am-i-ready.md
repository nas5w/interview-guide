# Am I Ready to Start Interviewing?

<star />

## It's not a yes/no question

This is _such_ a common question. The problem is it's not actually a yes/no question.

Someone who has done little prep could get lucky: they could get an interview that perfectly matches things they already know or the few things they studied. Conversely, someone who has done a ton of prep might get very unlucky or have a bad day.

## When in doubt, interview

If you even feel remotely prepared, **go for it**. What's the worst that could happen? You don't get the job. In that case:

- You've gained some great experience
- You can likely apply to the same company again in 6 to 12 months
- You get over your fear of failure (if that's something you experience)

When in doubt, do the interview!
