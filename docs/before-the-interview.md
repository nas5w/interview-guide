# Communication Before the Interview

## Recruiters are your friends

Most of your contact before an interview will be with the recruiter (and sometimes a separate coordinator).

With respect to the interviews, recruiters are your friends. I recommend framing your interactions with them with the mindset that they want you to succeed. This means that you should ask them questions that will help you be successful!

## Questions to ask

Before your interviews, there are a bunch of questions you should probably ask your recruiters. Here is a non-exhaustive list for both on-site and virtual interviews:

### On-site or virtual interviews

- Ask about dress code if they haven't told you already
- Ask what interview rounds you'll have. Behavioral, leetcode, practical coding, technical knowledge, values? Many people are surprised to hear that you can ask this and a lot of the time the recruiter will tell you what rounds you'll have. They may even tell you the order of these rounds.
- Ask if you can use your preferred language for the coding rounds (assuming you have coding rounds). Generally the answer is yes, but it's also possible the company has a specific language or framework they want you to use.
- Ask if you can use the Internet for practical coding rounds.

### On-site

- Confirm time and location. If you'll be traveling by plane or other company-paid mode of transportation, confirm logistics and a point-of-contact.
- Confirm interview a couple days in advance to make sure nothing has changed.

### Virtual

- Ask about what video software will be used. Download whatever software will be used and test it out days in advance.
- If there is a coding portion, ask how that's going to be conducted: will you be developing locally and screen-sharing? Or will you be using a shared, online environment like CodeSandbox? Whatever the answer, make sure you practice using that setup.

## Be a good person

I have seen far too many candidates self-sabotage by being rude or impolite. Being a good person doesn't just count in the interview rounds&mdash;it counts when interacting with recruiters as well. Treating someone with respect is the right thing to do, but it has the added benefit of giving you a better chance to get the job. Consider two candidates with identical technical skills, but one is a really nice person who seems great to work with and another came off as a bit of a jerk. Who would get the offer?
